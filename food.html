            <p>We opened in September 2003 but our story began long before that. Back when the only food sources were simple grains, dried beans, chicken, pork and summer vegetables women learned to season and flavor these with the things they had available, usually salt, pork and a few spices. We want everything, the food and especially the way you are served, to remind you of being home at Mama's kitchen table.</p><br>
